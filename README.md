# Image Processing Practice Repository

Welcome to the Image Processing Practice Repository! This repository contains my journey of exploring image processing techniques and honing my skills in this fascinating field. Each day's progress is organized into separate folders, making it easy to navigate and understand the different topics covered.

## Introduction

In this repository, I document my progress in image processing by practicing various techniques and implementations. This is not a consecutive daily log but rather a collection of different projects and experiments conducted on different days.

## Folder Structure

The repository is organized into folders, each representing a day's work. The structure is as follows:

- `day1/`: Image Processing Basics and Analysis
- `day2/`: Receipt Perspective Correction, Contours, and OCR
- `day3/`: Object Size Measurement

Feel free to explore each day's folder to see the specific code and details for that day's topic.

## Day 1: Image Processing Basics

On this day, I covered the fundamental concepts of image processing, including cropping, thresholding, and color manipulation. The code and explanations for these topics can be found in the `day1/` folder.

## Day 2: Receipt Perspective Correction and OCR

Day 2 was dedicated to advanced techniques such as correcting the perspective of a receipt image, detecting edges using contours, and performing Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to extract text from the receipt. Check out the `day2/` folder for more details.

## Day 3: Object Size Measurement

During this session, I delved into measuring the size of objects within an image based on a given size reference object. The code and methodology are available in the `day3/` folder.

## Usage

You are welcome to explore, learn from, and build upon the code in this repository for your own image processing projects. Make sure to have the necessary dependencies and libraries installed before running the code.

## Contributions

Contributions to this repository are currently not open. However, feel free to fork the repository and create your own version based on your learnings and experiences.
